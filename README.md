# BC Public Sector Salaries Database
### Irvin Ng, STAT545B, University of British Columbia

The Public Sector Salaries App is a shiny app which explores three datasets showing the salaries of employees working in BC's public sector. 

The data used in this app is open to the public and is published by [The Vancouver Sun](https://github.com/vs-postmedia/public-sector-salary-data.git).

For the purposes of app, we are only using three datasets: Post-Secondary Schools, Healthcare Agencies, and Public School Districts. Note that the database only consists of employees that make above $75,000 a year.

## How to run the app:
The app can run either through your browser or locally on R.
